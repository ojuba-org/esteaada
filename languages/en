To add a new file extension you need to know its header like : %PDF- for pdf files and mpg for mpg files . But not every file types have a right words then detecting files done by hexadecimal reading . Esteaada has three ways to read headers by hexadecimal reading . First it's reading 2 verse at multi divisions file types like jpg and exe , Second reading 4 verse at less divisions file types like java , Third reading 8 verse with non divisions file types like asf.
Esteaada read headers automaticlly by sample entery .
Also footer but don't add footer except when it non-variable for the file type .
